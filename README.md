## About PATCA

The Philippine Air Traffic Controllers' Association (PATCA) was founded on July 29, 1962, to promote and encourage the maintenance and continued development of aviation and air traffic control of the kind and quality required by the Commerce of the Republic of the Philippines, the National Defense and public welfare. We aim to conduct a professional and protective organization for the Air Traffic Controller of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines and all other persons who are interested in the air traffic control services and all necessary functions to enable its members to maintain a high degree of proficiency.
